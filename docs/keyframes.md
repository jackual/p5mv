# Keyframes and Animation

Custom inputs can be keyframed to change over the duration of a region. p5mv converts these keyframes into a per‑frame value during rendering using its easing library, so your p5 sketch receives a smoothly changing value.

## Creating keyframes

To create keyframes click the plus icon to save a value.

## Reset keyframes

Click the rubber icon to clear all keyframes


## Easing

Use the dropdown to select an [easing value](https://easings.net/).
